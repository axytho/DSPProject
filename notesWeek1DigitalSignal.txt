Week1 Digital Signal processing

6. With clipping, we have harmonics in the spectrum at 800 and 1200
7. toplay/max(toplay)
8. 100 is lumped with 200 in the theoretical spectrum, and non-existant in the recorded spectrum, 
200, 500 and 1000 are severely reduced, 1500 and 2000 are the least reduced, and 4000 is still noticable.
9. While the gaussian noise isn't perfectly flat across the frequency, it's close enough. The air/microphone filters out most stuff below 1000Hz and above 5000 Hz.
This is corroborated by the spectogram, where beyond 7500 and below 500, the frequency drops with dB/Hz
10. No
11 Using laptop

3.1 48 kHz speakers and microphone, so hard limit of 24 kHz
